# Palindrome
A dynamic programming approach to find the longest palindromic sequence of a given string and its length. The palindrome subsequence do not need to be contiguous. For example:

BBABCBCAB
has the palindromic subsequences "BBBBB", "BBCBB", "BABCBAB" among others. 

The program takes in an input file which contains a single string on a single line. 
The output is a palindromic subsequence of maximal length as well as the length itself.
